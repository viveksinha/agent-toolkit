# Launch Email

This skill helps write emails for product launches — from full-list announcements to segmented feature emails to changelog digests. Email consistently outperforms social for conversion because it reaches people who already care. The goal is to leverage that existing relationship: be direct, be valuable, and get the reader to the product fast.

## Email types by launch tier

### Tier 1: Full list announcement
For major new products or platform shifts. Goes to your entire subscriber list. This is your highest-stakes email — treat it accordingly.

Structure: Subject line → hero (what launched + why it matters) → visual (screenshot or GIF) → 2-3 supporting points → single CTA → signature.

Keep it under 400 words. Email is not a blog post. Link to the landing page and blog post for depth.

### Tier 2: Segment-specific announcement
For major new features that matter to a specific subset of users. Sends to the relevant segment only — this is both more targeted and protects your full list from email fatigue.

Structure: Subject → direct hook (why this segment should care) → what it does → how to try it → CTA.

Keep it under 300 words. The segment already knows your product; skip the preamble.

### Tier 3: Changelog digest
For smaller improvements, bundled weekly or biweekly. Goes to users who opt in to changelog updates.

Structure: "[Week of X] — What's new" → short bulleted list of improvements → link to full changelog.

Keep it under 150 words. Brevity signals respect for the reader's time.

## Subject lines

The subject line is the tweet first-line equivalent for email. It determines whether the email gets opened.

### What works

- **Specificity**: "Real-time transcription now supports 14 languages" outperforms "Big news about our API"
- **Value-forward**: Lead with what the reader gains, not what you shipped
- **Short**: Under 50 characters for mobile. The preview text carries the rest
- **No clickbait**: Your list opted in because they trust you. Don't abuse it

### Subject line formulas

- "Introducing [Product/Feature]: [one-line value prop]"
- "You can now [specific capability]"
- "[Product] just got [improvement] — here's what changed"
- "[Feature] is here: [concrete benefit]"
- "New: [specific thing] for [specific audience]"

### Preview text

Most email clients show 40-90 characters of preview text after the subject. Write it intentionally — don't let the email client pull the first line of body copy (often unreadable). The preview text should complement, not repeat, the subject.

Subject: "Introducing real-time translation for voice apps"
Preview: "14 languages, sub-200ms latency, available now on free tier"

### What to avoid

- "We're excited to announce..." (buries the value, overused)
- Emoji in subject lines (A/B test before using; often lowers open rate in B2B)
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation (spam filters + looks desperate)
- Vague teasers: "Something big is coming..." (erodes trust if overused)
- Misleading subjects that don't match the email content

## Announcement email structure

### Opening (1-2 sentences)
State what launched and the primary value. No warmup. No "Hope you're having a great week."

**Good:** "Today we're launching [Feature] — you can now [do specific thing] directly from [product]."

**Weak:** "We've been working hard on something we're really excited to share with you."

### Body (100-200 words)
Cover 2-3 supporting points. Each one should answer a reader question:
- What does it do? (if not fully clear from the opening)
- How does it work? (1-2 sentences, enough to reduce "is this too hard?" friction)
- Why does it matter? (concrete outcome, not abstract benefit)

Use short paragraphs — 2-3 sentences max. Emails with walls of text get skimmed or deleted.

### Visual
Include a product screenshot, GIF, or short video. Embed it, don't link to it. The visual should show the product doing the thing the opening promises. No stock photos.

### CTA
One link. Make it a button, not just a hyperlink. Be specific: "Try [Feature] now" beats "Learn more."

Place it prominently after the body — not buried at the bottom after a second screen of text.

### Signature
Keep it human. A name, role, and optionally a one-liner about what you're building. Avoid legal footers cluttering the main email body (put them in fine print below).

## Segmentation decisions

| Scenario | Segment |
|----------|---------|
| New product, new category | Full list |
| Major feature for power users | Users who use related features |
| Integration with third-party tool | Users who have connected that tool |
| Pricing change | Affected plan tiers only |
| Beta → GA | Users in beta + waitlist |
| Changelog digest | Changelog subscribers only |

Sending to the wrong segment is worse than not sending at all. A power-user feature email sent to inactive free users trains them to ignore your emails.

## Timing relative to social

Email is not the first thing you send on launch day — social is. The sequence:

1. **Social posts first** (early morning) — gets real-time engagement while the audience is active
2. **Blog post published** — the email links to it, so it must be live first
3. **Email send** (mid-morning to early afternoon) — captures people who missed social; gives the blog post backlink traffic

For Tier 1 launches, send email 2-4 hours after the social posts go out. This staggers your traffic sources and gives you something to say in the email ("Check out the full post →").

## Changelog digest format

The digest is a habit, not an announcement. It rewards users who stay subscribed by showing consistent momentum.

### Digest structure

```
Subject: [Product] updates — week of [date]

What's new this week:

• [Improvement 1] — one sentence on what changed and why it matters
• [Improvement 2] — same
• [Improvement 3] — same

[Optional: one sentence on what's coming next week]

→ Full changelog: [link]
```

Keep each bullet to one sentence. If an improvement needs more explanation, it probably warrants its own Tier 2 email.

Ship the digest on a consistent day (Friday afternoons work well — it's a low-send-competition window and feels like a weekly wrap-up).

## Common mistakes

- **Sending email before the landing page or blog post is live.** The email's job is to send people somewhere. Make sure the destination exists.
- **Too long.** Email is not the place for depth. Link to the blog post for that.
- **Multiple CTAs.** Every additional link after the primary CTA reduces its click rate. One destination per email.
- **Same email to everyone.** A feature announcement relevant to 20% of your list is noise for the other 80%.
- **No plain text version.** Some email clients block HTML. Send both.
- **Sending at the wrong time.** B2B emails perform best Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM in the recipient's timezone. Consumer/developer audiences skew later in the day.

## Companion skills

- **launch-strategy** — messaging brief (primary value prop and audience for the email)
- **launch-tweet** — social copy that goes out before the email
- **launch-blog-post** — the post the email links to
- **launch-distribution** — where email fits in the full distribution sequence
